# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-ML
This repository contains the project "Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning" which is done as a part of a task under Impacteers Club of VRSEC.

There are two .ipynb files in this repository. Both of them are regarding 'Breast Cancer Prediction' but are not related to each other in any other way. The .csv files are the datasets used for training and testing the machine learning models(i.e., they are used in the .ipynb files). 

  * data.csv is the dataset used in "Breast_Cancer_Kaggle.ipynb" and is taken from the link:- "https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data"
  * dataR1.csv is the dataset used in "Breast_Cancer_UCIdata.ipynb" and is taken from the link:- "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Coimbra#"
  
Both the .ipynb files are quite similar except for the datasets used. We have used two different datasets because both of them use different attributes to predict Breast Cancer and the dimensions of the datasets are also quite different. Both the .ipynb files are run on Google Colab. 

The accuracy obtained for these models vary each time you run it. This repository contains updated commit with the best results obtained.
